"""Wire protocol for the drone flyby use case.

These models mirror the evaluation service exactly. Keep them in sync: the
evaluator validates your response with the same rules, and a response that
fails validation is discarded together with every detection in it.

The asymmetry to internalise first is the protocol's, not the models':

* What you receive is **crop-local**. A 960x540 image of wherever the camera is
  pointed, plus the ``source_region_xyxy`` that says which part of the source
  frame it covers.
* What you send back is **frame-global**. ``annotations`` is your best
  prediction for the entire current source frame, with every box normalized
  against ``original_width`` and ``original_height``. Objects outside the
  current crop are valid answers.

Two smaller asymmetries in the models themselves:

* The request models are permissive. If the evaluator ever gains a field, your
  server keeps running instead of rejecting the frame.
* The response models are strict, because the evaluator's are. Unknown keys,
  numeric strings and floats where integers are expected are all rejected
  there, so it is better to find out here.
