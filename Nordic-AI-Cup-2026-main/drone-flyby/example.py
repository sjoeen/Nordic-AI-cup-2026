"""A baseline that answers the protocol correctly and detects almost nothing.

The point of this file is the plumbing, not the accuracy: it shows you how to
decode a view, lift boxes out of that view into the frame-global coordinates
the evaluator expects, and drive the camera without ever sending an illegal
command. Replace ``detect`` with your model and ``choose_next_view`` with your
camera policy.

It is stateless. Each response contains the detections made on the view that
arrived with that request, so at Level 1 and Level 2 it reports only the region
the camera is pointed at, while a frame's ground truth covers the whole source
frame.

Run ``python local_evaluator.py`` to see what it scores. It will be close to
zero, which is the honest starting point.
